In order to create an immutable class, you should follow the below steps:-

1.Make your class final, so that no other classes can extend it.

2.Make all your fields final, so that they’re initialized only once inside 
  the constructor and never modified afterward.
  
3.Don’t expose setter methods.

4.When exposing methods which modify the state of the class, 
  you must always return a new instance of the class.
  
5.If the class holds a mutable object:
  **Inside the constructor, make sure to use a clone copy of the 
    passed argument and never set your mutable field to the real 
    instance passed through constructor, this is to prevent the 
    clients who pass the object from modifying it afterwards.
  **Make sure to always return a clone copy of the field and never 
    return the real object instance.
